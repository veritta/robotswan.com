  blurb: |
    *Spine* is the name of a fictional design magazine that aims to unite high-quality creative content with popular appeal, targetting professionals, and amateur enthusiasts alike.
  description: |
    As part of an editorial project, three covers were created to suit the themes of ‘typography’, ‘poetry in motion’, and ‘women in graphic design’. A further component was the design of two articles which would be contained in the typography issue.

    *Spine* combines bold shapes and colours with strong typography to form eye-catching visuals that both reflect editorial content and target audience.
