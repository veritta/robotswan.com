    *Spine* is the name of a fictional design magazine that aims to unite high-quality creative content with popular appeal, targetting professionals, amateurs, and casual enthusiasts alike.

    As part of an editorial project, three covers were created to suit the themes of ‘typography’, ‘poetry in motion’, and ‘women in graphic design’. A further component was the design of two articles which would be contained in the typography issue.

    *Spine* combines bold shapes and colours with strong typography to form eye-catching visuals that both reflect editorial content and target audience.
