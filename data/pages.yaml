    ### Hello.
    I am a Sydney-based designer and illustrator.

    My main focuses are print and editorial design, illustration, and web design.

    When not completing a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Design (Visual Communication) at the University of Technology, Sydney, I spend my time crafting fictional universes, consuming novels, and wishing that hoverboards existed.
