    ### Hello.
    Robot Swan is the name that aspiring designer and illustrator Sunny X. Lai has chosen to differentiate herself in Google searches from the myriad medical professionals who share her name.

    Sunny is currently in her final year of a visual communication degree. She has been drawing since she was able to hold a pen; since then, her passion for illustration has expanded to encompass graphic design in general and typography, print, and cover design in particular. She also is a fan of all things digital, working primarily in Photoshop for both design and illustration, and more or less living on the Internet otherwise.

    When not chasing the artistic/designerly dream, Sunny enjoys listening to moody electropop, learning foreign languages, and reading novels while stuffing her face.
