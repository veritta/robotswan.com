    ### Hello.
    I am a designer and illustrator based in Sydney, Australia.

    My work is largely digital and my main interests are print and editorial design, illustration, and web design.

    Aside from completing a Bachelor of Design in Visual Communication at the University of Technology, Sydney, I also spend my time working on personal projects, listening to moody electropop, consuming novels, and wishing that hoverboards existed.
