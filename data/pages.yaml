    ### Hello.
    Robot Swan is the name that Sunny X. Lai has chosen to differentiate herself in Google searches from the myriad medical professionals who share her name. (The Google thing is also the reason for the middle initial. It looks pretentious, but it's real, she swears.)

    Sunny is a graphic designer and illustrator who holds a combined Bachelor of Visual Communication and Bachelor of Arts in International Studies.

    She likes typography, the Internet, drawing, and science fiction novels.
